**ARK Mod Downloader**
------------------------------
As many know you cannot simply download ARK mods via SteamCMD.  The individual files come archived as .z files which will not work with a server. 

This tool works around this issue by downloading the mod and extracting the .z files. 
Was ported for Linux. If you want to rather choose the Windows version, go to original maintainer!

**Usage**

You can either run this tool via the .exe provided in the dist folder or directly via the Ark_Mod_Downloader Python script.

***Commandline Args***

**--workingdir** - (Optional) - This is the home directory of your ARK server

**--modid** - The ID of the mod you wish to download 

**--steamcmd** - (Optional) - The directory to the SteamCMD exe you wish to use.  If not provided the tool will download SteamCMD to the CWD

**--update** - (Optional) - This will update all current mods installed on the server

**--namefile** - (Optional) - This will create a "Modname.name" file in the mod folder. 

The only required argument is the --modid if you run this script from the root of your Game Server.
